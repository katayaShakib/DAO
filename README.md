# Full-stack-onchain-DAO

Anyone who owns a CryptoDevs NFT (created before under the name of "NFT Collection") can create a proposal to purchase a different NFT from a fake NFT marketplace (simulates the behavior of a real one. Created for the purpose of testing this dApp to keep things simple).

Everyone with a CryptoDevs NFT can vote for or against the active proposals.

Each NFT counts as one vote for each proposal.

Voters cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal with the same NFT.

If majority of the voters vote in favor of the proposal by the deadline, the NFT purchase happens automatically from the marketplace.
